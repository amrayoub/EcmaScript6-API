# EcmaScript6-API
In the code along we will use the PokemonAPI (http://pokeapi.co/) to apply our knowledge so far! We will also use Fetch to access our data, Fetch is not part of ES6, but it is a new API in the browser that returns ES6 promises!

1-Make sure that your chrome browser support ES6  , Go to  chrome://flags , then search for "Experimental JavaScript" then enbale it .
2- Run index.html
